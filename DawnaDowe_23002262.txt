My name is Dawna Dowe Ajan with matrix number, 23002262. I am majoring in Software Engineering. This is my first time taking the Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling nervous about taking this subject. This is because I am not very skilled in programming.

I acquired B+ for my previous Programming 1 course. It's not too bad. So, I think I can manage to get A for this DS Subject this term. In order to do well in the subject, I will revise and do a lot of self-study. Wish me luck!!!

I performed better than I expected. Therefore, I am very happy and satisfied with my performance.

DS taught me to understand how programming works better. I got the grade I targeted.
